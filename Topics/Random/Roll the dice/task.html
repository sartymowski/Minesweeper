<h2>Roll the dice</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p></p>
<p>Let's play a game. We'll write a program that simulates rolling a six-sided dice. Players roll it over and over again and it produces numbers from 1 to 6 in an almost unpredictable way.</p>
<p>Your task is to write a function that returns a random integer value in the interval [1, 6] each time it's called.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> Use lower and upper bounds to set the proper range for a dice value.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
